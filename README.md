This project is a push-button counter using an ESP32 and Arduino IDE. Every time the button is pressed, the counter value increases, and the result is displayed on the Serial Monitor.

COMPONENTS REQUIRED:--

•ESP32 Development Board

•Push Button

•10kΩ Resistor (optional for pull-down)

•Connecting Wires

•Breadboard

CIRCUIT CONNECTION:--

Push Button: One side to GPIO4 and the other to GND.

Internal Pull-up Resistor: Used to keep the button in a stable HIGH state when not pressed.

WORKING:--

The ESP32 detects when the button is pressed.

Each press increments a counter.

The updated count is printed to the Serial Monitor.
